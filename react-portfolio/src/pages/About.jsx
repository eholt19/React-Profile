            Hi! Iâ€™m Emily, a full-stack web developer and recent graduate of the University of Utah Coding Bootcamp.
            I transitioned into tech from a background in education, where I worked closely with students and led classroom instruction.
            I love building clean, functional web apps and I'm always looking to learn and grow as a developer.
